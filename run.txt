docker image name developed -> kodecloud/simplewebapp

=> docker run kodecloud/simplewebapp
its runs in foreground or in attached mode
i.e, will be attached to console or standard output.
We wont be able to do anything until this container
stops.

docker run -d kodecloud/simplewebapp
This will run the docker container in the background 
mode and we will return back to prompt 

if want to attach again
=> docker attach kodecloud/simplewebapp



=======================================================

docker run -it ubuntu
=> -it stands for interactive
=> to start a container and interact with it
=> what we will get is a shell

    & passes it to OS

[root@2ecc4cd65705 /]
